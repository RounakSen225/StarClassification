# Star Classification
This project is mainly to classify stars separately into their subgroups using Logistic Regression. Stas can be classified using their Luminosity and Temperature data, as is seen from the Hertzsprungâ€“Russell diagram: https://courses.lumenlearning.com/astronomy/chapter/the-h-r-diagram/

SEXtractor : The images from SDSS have a collection of galxies and stars in it, but we need a separate cutout image for each object (removing the dark background which is noise and doesnot contribute to input). SEXtractor does this job of filtering out images.
SExtractor (Source-Extractor) is a program that builds a catalogue of objects from an astronomical image. It is particularly oriented towards reduction of large scale galaxy-survey data, but it also performs well on moderately crowded star fields.
The basic working procedure of SEXtractor is given here:

The data has been taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey(SDSS), which has thousands of images of stars, galaxies, quasars etc.
